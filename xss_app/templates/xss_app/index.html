            <p class="lead">
                Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web
                applications. This flaw allows attackers to <b>inject malicious scripts</b> into web pages viewed by
                other users. XSS attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper
                validation or escaping, thereby enabling attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser. Such
                scripts can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser
                and used with that site, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious activities. XSS
                vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting malicious links, form inputs, or URL parameters, and they
                are mitigated through proper data sanitization, validation, and the use of secure coding practices.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This tutorial is going to guide you through carrying out two of the most common XSS attacks and show you
            how to defend against them, even if you have no prior practical experience with these attacks.
            There will be four exercises for you to complete, with hints and solutions available if needed.
            <br><br>
            This web application is used for creating, displaying and searching for blog posts made by users. It is
            quite vulnerable and you will exploit these vulnerabilities. You can see all the blog posts, the search bar,
            and the form for creating new blog posts near the bottom of the page.
            Let's get started!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="typesOfXSS">
        <h2>Types of XSS attacks</h2>
        <p>
            There are two most common XSS attacks: <b>Reflected</b> and <b>Stored</b>. Both of these attacks target
            the users of the web application, exploiting their trust in the web application. The attackers try to
            inject the web application with a malicious script, be it JavaScript, HTML Flash, PHP, or other type of code
            that can execute in a victim's browser, and use it to steal cookies, session tokens, sensitive
            information the browser stores, or deface the web page and even redirect the user to malicious sites.
            The main difference between these attacks is <b>how</b> the injection occurs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now we will look into what do we need in order to carry out an actual XSS attack in general, and later we
            will look into the specifics of Reflected and Stored attacks. If you want to learn more about these or other
            less common attacks, checkout the official OWASP website:
            <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/" target="_blank">XSS Attacks</a>
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="carryOutXSS">
        <h2>How to carry out XSS attacks</h2>
        <p>In order to carry out XSS attacks, we need to complete these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First of all we need to ask ourselves - what is our goal? Are we trying to steal personal information?
                Are we trying to steal session cookies and conduct session hijacking? Or are we hacktivists trying
                to draw attention to something?
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once we know our goal, we need to do reconnaisance of the application. This includes inspecting the
                application to see what types of cookies it stores, as well as understanding the structure of the front
                end. Furthermore, recall that the malicious content is injected through a user <b>input</b> and executed
                when the browser renders the <b>output</b>. This means we have to figure out if and where is the
                web application vulnerable by testing out different locations of inputs and outputs.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After figuring out <b>what</b> do we want to achieve and <b>where</b> the vulnerability is, we need to
                craft our malicious script accordingly and inject it.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="reflectedExercise">
        <h2 id="reflectedXSS">Reflected XSS</h2>
        <p>
            In Reflected XSS attack the attacker injects
            malicious script into a webpage through user's request (like in a
            search form or URL parameter) and includes it directly in its response without proper validation or
            encoding, which is then immediately reflected back to the user and executed by their
            web browser. The malicious script, embedded in a crafted request (often a URL), is 'reflected' back to the
            user's browser, where it executes in the context of the user's session. Unlike Stored XSS, which persists in
            the web application, Reflected XSS is non-persistent
            and requires a user to actively trigger the attack, often through clicking on a link or a misleading email.
            While it requires more direct interaction with the target user, Reflected XSS is still a dangerous and
            common form of web application vulnerability due to its potential for immediate impact and its relative ease
            of execution.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="exercise1">Exercise 1 - Basic Reflected Attack</h4>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, reflected XSS attacks reflect the user input directly onto the rendered page. Try
            using the search bar below to search for a blog post. You can see the posted blog posts and form for creating
            new ones lower on this page!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="search">
        <h4>Search</h4>
        <form action="{% url 'xss_app:search' %}" method="get">
            <div class="form-group">
                <label for="searchBar">Search for a blog post</label>

            </div>
        </form>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="storedExercises">
        <h2 id="storedXSS">Stored XSS</h2>
        <p>
            In Stored XSS attack the attacker injects malicious scripts into a web applicationâ€™s database.
            This typically happens through input forms or any other data submission points that accept user-generated
            content and store it. The malicious script, once stored,
            is then served as part of the web application's content to other users. When these users access the
            compromised page, the malicious script executes in their browsers. Unlike other forms of XSS, stored XSS
            does not require a victim to click on a link; it automatically executes when the compromised page is loaded.
            Due to its persistent nature and potential for widespread impact on users, stored XSS is often considered more
            severe than other types of XSS attacks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="exercise2">Exercise 2 - Basic Stored Attack</h4>
            <p>
                Below you can see all the blog posts, their author, and the date and time they were posted. These blog
                posts are persistent data which is stored in a database and displayed by the frontend.
                <br><br>
                Just as in the previous exercise, you have to display the website's cookie using the blog posts. If you are not
                sure how to proceed, take a look at the blog posts, maybe they contain something interesting! Or maybe
                you already know exactly what to do, in that case do what you need to do!

    <div id="defences">
        <h2>XSS Defences</h2>
        <p>
            Defending against any type of attack requires robust and deep defence - implementing just a single method is
            usually not enough! This section outlines some of the common methods of protecting your web application
            from XSS attacks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Output Encoding</h4>
        <p>
            Output encoding ensures that any user-generated input displayed on the page is escaped correctly,
            meaning that characters that could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript are converted to safe representations.
            Here are some common problematic characters that should be encoded
        </p>
        <pre class="code-snippet"><code>Convert <b>&</b> to <b>&amp;amp;</b> | <b><</b>  to <b>&amp;lt;</b> | <b></b>to <b>&amp;gt;</b> | <b>"</b> to <b>&amp;quot;</b> | and <b>'</b> to <b>&amp;#x27;</b></code></pre>
        <br>
        <h4>Input Validation and Sanitization</h4>
        <p>
            Escape dangerous characters supplied in user input and accept only known good input by using whitelists for
            headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, hidden fields, and other data. While input sanitization is
            overall one of the most important aspects of computer security, for XSS prevention output encoding is much
            more important, because the script execution happens during rendering of the output.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Content Security Policy</h4>
        <p>
            Content security policy (CSP) headers restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
            CSP can effectively prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts, even if an attacker manages to inject
            malicious code into your webpage. Here is an example of such HTTP header
        </p>
        <pre class="code-snippet"><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self';</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>default-src 'self' only allows content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) from the site's own domain.</li>
            <li>script-src 'self' only allows JavaScript to be executed if it comes from the same domain. This <b>excludes inline scripts</b> and scripts loaded from other domains.</li>
            <li>object-src 'none' prevents loading plugins like Flash.</li>
            <li>base-uri 'self' restricts the URLs which can be used in a document's &lt;base&gt; element.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>HttpOnly</h4>
        <p>
            Use the HttpOnly flag to prevent access to cookie data via JavaScript. This can help mitigate the damage
            of certain XSS attacks by not allowing stolen cookies to be used in session hijacking. The HttpOnly
            attribute is specified in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header from the server.
        </p>
        <pre class="code-snippet"><code>Set-Cookie: SessionId=xyz123; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2024 10:18:14 GMT; HttpOnly</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>SessionId=xyz123 is the cookie being set.</li>
            <li>Path=/ indicates that the cookie is available for pages under the specified path (in this case, the root directory).</li>
            <li>Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2024 10:18:14 GMT specifies when the cookie will expire and be removed.</li>
            <li><b>HttpOnly</b> tells the browser that this cookie should not be accessible via JavaScript through the Document.cookie API or other client-side mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>
